            <p>Lombok is a popular Java library that can be used in Spring Boot projects to help reduce boilerplate
                code. It provides a set of annotations that can be used to generate getters, setters, constructors, and
                other commonly used methods automatically at compile time, thus saving developers from writing them
                manually.</p>
            <p>To use Lombok in a Spring Boot project, you need to add the Lombok dependency to your project's build
                file (pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle). Once you have added the Lombok dependency, you can
                start using its annotations in your code.</p>
            <h2>Commonly Used Lombok Annotations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>@Getter and @Setter:</strong> These annotations generate getter and setter methods for class
                    fields, respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>@NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor:</strong> These annotations generate a
                    no-argument constructor and a constructor that accepts all fields as arguments, respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>@Data:</strong> This annotation is a shorthand for @Getter, @Setter, @EqualsAndHashCode, and
                    @ToString.</li>
                <li><strong>@Builder:</strong> This annotation generates a builder pattern for a class, allowing you to
                    easily create instances of the class with a fluent API.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using Lombok can help reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write in your Spring Boot
                projects, making your code more concise and easier to read. However, it's important to note that some
                developers may find it harder to understand the code if they're not familiar with Lombok annotations.
